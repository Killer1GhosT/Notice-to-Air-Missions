APPROACH METHOD, LANDING RUNWAY AND PARKING STAND.
3.PILOT CAN DIRECTLY USE THE LID INFORMATION FOR Flight Management System PREPARATION
DURING CRUISE PHASE WITHOUT RADIO CONFIRMATION BY Area Control;
4.ON INITIAL CONTACT SHANGHAI APPROACH,PILOT SHOULD ADVISE YOUR
LID INFORMATION AT LEAST INCLUDING EXPECTED ARRIVAL PROCEDURE,
APPROACH METHOD, AND LANDING RUNWAY;
5.SHANGHAI APPROACH WILL CONFIRM OR MODIFY  FROM PILOT LID REPORT:
